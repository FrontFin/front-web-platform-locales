    "paragraph10": "The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by these terms. The Consumer Arbitration Rules are available online at <2>https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf</2>. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If you and the Company are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow these terms and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these terms, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.",

If any term is unenforceable under applicable law, then that term is hereby amended so as to comply with the law, while preserving to the maximum extent possible the intent of the original term. Any term that cannot be so amended will be severed and all remaining terms will remain in effect.

You hereby authorize the Company and its service providers to transmit instructions as well as information, data and other materials between the End User Service and each Connected Account, and you acknowledge and agree that the Company and its service providers have no responsibility or liability for the execution of any such instructions, or for any such materials (including their accuracy, timeliness or completeness).",

Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to these terms or any aspect of the relationship between you and the Company, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that the Company and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. Such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge.
